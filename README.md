# Robotics
This project contains Arduino code for controlling a car-like robot. The robot is equipped with 4 sensors, two in the front of robot and the other two on the left and right side of the robot. The navigation and wall detection are determined by the value read by robot's sensors. This project contains 4 labs
- Lab 1: basic controls of the robot, containing moving robot forward, backward, clockwise, anticlockwise and 8-open loop navigation.
- Lab 2: basic sensors value readings, wall detection and wall following
- Lab 3: Maze following and localisation
- Lab 4: Path planning
